# Project: Visualizing NYC Payroll Data :chart_with_upwards_trend:
Data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/nyc-citywide-payroll-data).

The data isn't anything special, but it offers a lot of cleaning and discerning! I had fun with it and learned a lot along the way.

## Here is what I Found! (Code can be found in the .py file!) 

Here is a breakdown of the most employees by Agency per year. I chose to use this style of graph that way you can see any discrepancies
easily seeing them side by side and the bold color helps notice the bars and you could see the difference in the heights per year. One thing to note is the size of "Police Department" is different between the years due to the name not being a unique value in the data set.

These could have been merged into one graph, just to note.

Who were the lowest paid employees and in what years (We could have done a breakdown year by year and graph the change)?
